----------

This is an interactive webpage that plays various Beyonce songs. The lemons in the center of the page pulse to the beat of each song (calculated by BPM). 

The control bar at the bottom lets a user play a random Beyonce song, pause and skip to another song. The additional icons let the user add soundbites from other songs to make the listening experience more customized and interactive for the user.  

Below are the four songs that play at random: 
1. "Crazy In Love"
2. "Single Ladies"
3. "Partition"
4. "Formation"

And these are the functions of the icons:
- Clock: "Ring the Alarm" audio clip
- Crown: "Flawless" audio clip
- Lipstick: "Diva" audio clip
- Play: plays a random song from the above list
- Pause: pauses the playing song
- Next: skips to another song at random from the above list
- Cake: "Yonce" audio clip
- Hot sauce: "Formation" audio clip
- Ring: "Single Ladies" audio clip
- Heart: "Crazy in Love" audio clip
